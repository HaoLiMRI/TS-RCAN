"""
"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"""
This is the current version we are working on, in 20210206
This is a demo code of 2D_MRI_SR_Dual_Domain. in this version we have already support following items:
    0)  Dual Domain Fusion Network Achitecture, where we already support:
        a) use RCAN or U-Net as main framework, for image single branch network.
        b) gradient map branch as secondary branch, together with main(image) branch, in the framework of RCAN
        b) k space branch as secondary branch, together with main(image) branch, in the framework of RCAN
        c) high frequency component extracted using wavelet transformation and wavelet branch as 
            secondary branch, together with main(image) branch, in the framework of RCAN
        d) interleaving fusion between image branch and  as secondary branch at intermedian level
        e) late stage fusion of outcome from image branch and outcome from secondary branchbranch
    Besides, we already support other features:
    1)  option to add a VGG feature extractor in front of the main "CNN based Reconstruct network"(so the input to "CNN based Reconstruct network" is feature map of LR image)
    2)  either Pixel-Wise MSE loss or Pixel-Wise smooth L1 loss (L1_Charbonnier_Loss is also availbe). 
    3)  weighted k space loss(fft loss)
    4)  weighted VGG loss
    5)  L2 Regularization
    6)  option to add ssim smooth L1 loss
    7)  option to add gradient map smoothL1 loss
    8） option to add gram matrix smoothL1 loss(for increasing texture similarity between SR and HR)
	9)  option to use lookahead optimizer
    10) option to use CosineAnnealingLR learning rate decay. See https://blog.zhujian.life/posts/6eb7f24f.html for more info 
    11) option to choose different gradient_operator
    12) option to use coord_conv(See [20])
    13) option to use deformable_conv(However we are running in CUDA out of memory, although already used tc.cuda.empty_cache() for deformable_conv)
    14) option to use py_conv(See [24])
    15) option to use Sine(SIREN) activation function
    16) option to use FReLU activation function
    17) option to use channel attention for cross branch fusion
    18) option to use "1 - exp(-alpha*gradient_map)" to amplify small values in gradient map to emphasize the information from 
        gradient values which stand for texture
    19) option to amplify high frequency loss value in k space loss. We can use weight for "square of difference between one element of SR k space data matrix and corresponding element
        of HR k space data matrix" which follows the 2D Gaussian distribution. Cause the center part of k space data matrix
        stands for high frequency part where we observed the most significant mismatch happened between SR and HR k space 
        data, we expect to give higher weight on center part of difference and lower weight on edge part of difference in the
        k space data matrix for the k space loss.
    20) option to use "warm up learning rate" to set up the relative small learning rate in the beginning of training, then change to normal scheduler
        to apply the large learning rate and lower the learning rate graduately. We could avoid using large learning rate in the very beginning by doing
        such, thus avoid "unstable" training(e.g. The loss becomes very large suddenly in the first several epoch).
        Warm up指的是用一个小的学习率先训练几个epoch，这是因为网络的参数是随机初始化的，假如一开始就采用较大的学习率容易出现数值不稳定，这也是为什么要使用Warm up。
        然后等到训练过程基本上稳定了就可以使用原始的初始学习率进行训练了。
    21) Re-implement deformable conv filter(search ConvOffset2D), to make it runnable now without memory problem. Only tested with RCAN network, defaul conv, ReLU.
    22) option to use Dynamic ReLU Type A and Type B activation function.
    23) option to set up args['number_of_progressive_stage'] as 1, 2, 3, to support args['scale']^args['number_of_progressive_stage'] progressive 4x and 8x upsampling reconstruction.
    24) option to use "normal end to end channel and spatial attention block"(CAM and SAM are implemented for channel and spatial attention, see paper:2018.CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module
        for more detail information.) for upsampler (inside upsampler, after first conv and before pixel shuffle).
    25) option to use "self-attention based end to end channel and spatial attention block"(The non-local self-attention based channel attention and non-local self-attention are implemented according 
        to paper: 2018.Dual Attention Network for Scene Segmentation) for upsampler. The non-local self-attention spatial and channel attention mechanism employed in DANet is, the Self-Attention(Also 
        called as Non-Local Attention, see paper: 2018.Non-local Neural Networks and paper: 2019.Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks for more details about Self-Attention) which borrows from 
        the self-attention mechanism in the classical paper in NLP which proposes the Transformer technology: 2017.Attention is All You Needed.
    26) option to use "normal end to end channel and spatial attention block"(CAM and SAM in CBAM framework) and "self-attention based end to end channel and spatial attention block"(self_attention framework)
        as basic block in every RCAB(for both main branch and second branch if dual branch network is turned), to replace the CALayer.
    27) For all the "normal end to end channel and spatial attention block" and "self-attention based end to end channel and spatial attention block", either "sequential_mode" or "parallel_mode" could be selected.
28) option to use "negative total variation loss(tv_loss)". minimize总变差（TV）loss促进了生成的图像中的空间平滑性,于是minimize negative tv loss防止过度平滑
    29) option to use "negative trace loss". 用minimize 1/trace(SR*HR)做为negative trace loss。trace(SR*HR)表示SR和HR的相似程度。两个向量内积是把一个向量投影到另一个上的长度，这个值可以用于描述两个向量的相似性。两个矩阵A、B的相似性
        可以用A、B两个矩阵的内积表征，被定义为Trace(AB)。见paper: 2015.LRTV: MR Image Super-Resolution With Low-Rank and Total Variation Regularizations
30) option to use HR reference with self-attention in the end. 使用MRI HR reference的MRI SR网络并联两个现有的branch，一个branch用于LR的放大，另一个用于给HR reference的feature extraction（去掉upsampler），
        最后用一个self-attention的upsampler来把俩者fuse到一起生成MRI SR。这个方案的思路是用CNN去抓取LR图像和HR图像的局部特征的feature，然后用self-attention方案去找到这些局部feature在整个图上（全局上，更大的范围）的关系。
        模型的结构可以参考Paper: 2020.Attention-based Image Upsampling. https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09904
    31) option to add long skip connection outside the entire network model to only reconstruct the residual part of HR MRI image.从而让网络从用LR生成SR变为用LR恢复SR和LR+bicubic padding相差的部分。
    32) option to use Gradient map guided pixel-wise loss. SR和HR分别求gradient map，再相减得到一个gradient map差的矩阵，再把这个gradient map差的矩阵从(H * W)变为(1 * HW)，然后再过一个softmax，再变回H * W，然后把得到的矩
        阵当做pixel-wise L1 loss的weight来元素乘在L1 loss的pixel上。
    33) option to use SSIM map guided pixel-wise loss. SR和HR求SSIM map，再用1减这个SSIM map得到一个矩阵当做pixel-wise L1 loss的weight来元素乘在L1 loss的pixel上。


Some feature or bug fixing which have already been planed/started but still not finished yet:
    1) U-Net is already used as framework for image single branch. But not support for any of dual domain branch yet! Thus the class "U_Net_Based_MRI_SR_Dual_Domain_2D" still needs to be
        changed to support U-Net as framework for 3 types of dual domain branch.
    2) k space, wavelet secondary branch多个分量间分开，各走一个branch来实现。
    3) option to use HR reference with self-attention in the end这个方案已经代码已经完成。但现在只支持RCAN的image_single_domain或者gradient_map_dual_domain在没有long_skip_connection_to_reconstruct_residual_part_only时的
        HR reference based network。不支持其他配置时的HR reference based network。注意：现在gradient_map_dual_domain时用HR reference based network还有问题，会out of memory。
    4) 另外，现在option to use HR reference with self-attention in the end这个方案如果在网络用self-attention，则会out of memory。
    5) option to add long skip connection outside the entire network model to only reconstruct the residual part of HR MRI image这个选项现阶段仅支持非HR Reference based的网络结构。


we will plan to support other features:
    1) multi-kernel size deformable conv in different paths and fuse together, see [26] for similar idea
    2) kernel size wise attention[25] for multi-kernel size deformable conv
    3) multi-kernel size dilated conv in different paths and fuse together[26]
    4) kernel size wise attention[25] for multi-kernel size dilated conv
    5) feature scale wise attention for py_conv
    6) set threshold_low and threshold_high for "contrast between each pixel and all the pixels around it", if contrast is
        lower than threshold_high, we have to limit the contrast to let it should be larger than threshold_low. The actual
        threshold_low for contrast between each pixel and all the pixels around it may follow Gaussian distribution(The 
        closer the pixels are the larger threshold_low should be, doing like this lead the contrast between two pixels which
        are close to each other large enough, so they will NOT be samiliar and the super resolution result will NOT be too
        smooth in texture wise.)
    7) 完成基于He Kaiming的paper: 2019.Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks内figure 3提出的为semantic segmentation任务提出的Panoptic FPN方案来增强U-Net framework对于多尺度信息的提取恢复。
        现阶段已经用"Channel and Spatial Attention Block"模块替换掉了CA Lyaer从而组成新的RCSAB，然后多个RCSAB构成新的RG，每个RG作为U-Net framework中的encoder的每一层。基于这种U-Net 
        framework我们可以在decoder的所有层连上这种Panoptic FPN结构从而构成Panoptic U-Net framework.
    8) non-local edge attention. 受paper: 2019.Local Relation Networks for Image Recognition中figure2的启发，那个图它引入了一个什么geometry prior，然后说要对each spatial position来做self-attention。
        我们可以像它这样，但不对每一个spatial position来做，而是做self-attention的部分引入一个LR的图的Gradient map, 然后将这个gradient map reshape成为一个1 x NW的向量，再和自己的转置相乘得到一个
        pixel-wise的互相关矩阵，再通过一个softmax或sigmoid（和self-attention的通过Pixel-wise互相关矩阵求取每个pixel和其他所有pixel之间的相关性再通过softmax的操作逻辑一样）变成一个归一化了的权重矩阵。
        再将这个基于Gradient map求出来的权重矩阵乘以self-attention模块中的Value矩阵，然后再和“key和query求Pixel-wise的互相关矩阵过softmax之后得到的权重矩阵”再相乘，从而输出一个同时被non-local 
        self-attention强调和gradient map edge强调过的feature map。那这个non-local edge attention模块同时放在整个网络的最前面（做第一个block）给LR输入加一个edge attention的guidence，和最后面（做最
        后一个block）给SR输出加一个edge attention的guidence。
        **Beware: 这个idea应该对MRI segmentation一样靠谱！！！！！
    9) 那么对于8)中提出的基于HR reference的MRI SR网络，其实也可以对输入的HR reference MRI数据在网络的一开始做non-local edge attention，以及fft求k space去掉低频仅保留高频再ifft之后做non-local edge attention
        类似的操作求出一个high frequency self-attention，这样得到一个被gradient map edge强调和的high frequency self-attention强调的feature map来和LR生成SR的branch进行fuse。
    10) consider adding dual regression loss(See paper: 2020.Closed-loop Matters: Dual Regression Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution).
    11) Pair-wise and Patch-wise Attention. See paper: 2019.Exploring self-attention for image recognition
    12) Criss-cross Attention. Criss-cross Attention could reduce the computational burden which introduces from non-local self-attention block(has a high complexity of O(N2), where N denotes 
        the number of input feature maps). The criss-cross attention module that for each pixel position generates a sparse attention map only on the criss-cross path. Further, by applying 
        criss-cross attention recurrently, each pixel position can capture context from all other pixels. Compared to non-local self-attention block, the criss-cross uses 11× lesser GPU memory, 
        and has a complexity of O(2√N).
        See paper: 2019.CCNet: Criss-cross attention for semantic segmentation
    13) 看懂PC（Phase Congruency）怎么算，把这个指标做loss项。 参考论文：2011.FSIM: A Feature Similarity Index for Image Quality Assessment 参考代码：https://github.com/sunxirui310/FSIM-FSIMc-matlab/blob/master/FSIM.m
    14) 受paper: 2019.Local Relation Networks for Image Recognition中figure2的启发，那个图它引入了一个什么geometry prior，然后说要对each spatial position来做self-attention。我们可以像它这样，但不对每一个spatial position来做，
        而是在option to use HR reference with self-attention in the end方案实现using HR reference with self-attention in the end那样最后做self-attention的部分引入一个比如LR的图的Gradient map像它这个geometry prior一样加到self-attention里面。
    15) 我们的HR reference based网络也应该让它经过小波变换，然后只保留高频部分进入网络帮助LR做SR。无论对于自己的HR reference网络还是TTSR都可以这样做下,对于TTSR则可以直接对HR Reference
        做小波变换保留3个高频分量放在3个channel上面进入LTE。对于我们自己的HR reference网络则可以考虑把LR复制3份，分别于HR reference的小波变换的3个高频分量各自过self-attention
        一起组成multi-head self-attention。


We also fixed bugs from previous versions, typical ones like:
    1) After PyTorch version 1.1, call scheduler.step() will overwrite the learning rate used in optimizer to be same as scheduler sets up immediately.
    2) Also beware the scheduler.step() should be called every epoch rather than every batch. It means scheduler.step() should
        only be after and outside of "for loop of batch".
    3) Previsouly the neural network has been initialized automatically by PyTorch framework, although such initialization has not been explicitly shown. 
        So we add xavier and Kaiming initialization explicitly in this version of code.(but might not be really used since it is NOT common to use weight 
        initialization for super resolution task).
    4) Add the code to always select the weights of network which provides the best value in average SSIM over all batches for validation
        in one epoch, and save the selected weights of network and corresponding LR and SR data.
    5) When accumulate the loss in the training step, only add the value of loss into by using loss_bullet.item(), e.g. ssim_loss_training += ssim_loss.item(), rather than adding the entire
        computational graph into(e.g. ssim_loss_training += ssim_loss). Thus avoid using too much GPU memory which is not necessary.
    6) Replace the mean SSIM (a single value) by using SSIM map (a matrix) in the ssim loss.
    7) Fix "wrongly reuse the same conv for different branch" bugs in GradientMapDualResidualGroup, RCAN_Based_MRI_SR_Dual_Domain_2D, Progressive_Learning_Wrapper_MRI_SR_Dual_Domain_2D.
    
    In this 2D version, the data format has been changed. The input data is just 64 x 64 2D matrix rather than 64 x 64 x 64, we already 
    collapse all the 64 layers into only one layer in the data tailing and noise filtering processing.

"""
Note: 小波变换（wavelet transform，WT）是一种新的变换分析方法，它继承和发展了短时傅立叶变换局部化的思想，同时又克服了窗口大小不随频率变化等缺
点，能够提供一个随频率改变的“时间-频率”窗口，是进行信号时频分析和处理的理想工具。它的主要特点是通过变换能够充分突出问题某些方面的特征，能对时
间（空间）频率的局部化分析，通过伸缩平移运算对信号（函数)逐步进行多尺度细化，最终达到高频处时间细分，低频处频率细分，能自动适应时频信号分析的
要求，从而可聚焦到信号的任意细节，解决了Fourier变换的困难问题。
小波变换使用的基底函数不像FFT那样是三角函数，而是小波函数。所谓“小波函数”是一类函数，该类型函数需要满足：均值为0并在时域和频域都局部化
（不是蔓延整个坐标轴的），满足这两条的函数就是小波函数。具体来说，就是小波在整个时间范围的幅度平均值是0，具有有限的持续时间和突变的频率和振幅，
可以是不规则，也可以是不对称。
小波有很多，最简单的是Haar Wavelet。所以小波分析或者说小波变换要做的就是将原始信号表示为一组小波基的线性组合，然后通过忽略其中不重要的部分达
到数据压缩或者说降维的目的。另外注意小波变换的结果是2D的时频谱，不是FFT那样的1D频谱。
